PREREQUISITES

tei2epub will provide automatic epubcheck validation if installed.

This package should have come with an epubtools library at the top.  First install that:

$ cd epubtools

Modify epubtools/settings.py to point to your epubcheck installation, then:

$ python setup.py install

To test your tei2epub installation, run:

  bin/tei2epub.py sample/Wuthering-Heights_Emily-Bronte.xml

If all goes well it will say:

  "No errors or warnings were detected"

(that's validation from epubcheck if you have it installed)

and there will be a Wuthering-Heights_Emily-Bronte.epub in the 'dist'
folder.
